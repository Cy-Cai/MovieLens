## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r top rating}
edx %>% group_by(rating) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% top_n(5) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r rating, echo=FALSE}

edx %>%
  group_by(rating) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = count)) +
  geom_line()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
